### ReWind-Card

inspiration by UNOCSS, so this project is like a UNO reverse card, converts to CSS property to Tailwind CSS class, and

## About The Project

In my experience in frontend development, functional CSS frameworks (like Tailwind CSS, WindiCSS, or UNOCSS) have a nice performance in Page Speed and Development Experience (DX). However, it wonâ€™t be easy to rewrite a new page when the project is ongoing and launched when the learning cost is still high. So, I make a transformer program (currently are CLI program that ðŸ˜… ) to convert the CSS property to Tailwind-like CSS class (or, say, tailwind-token)

 So in my case, I have a Vue Component Library with many SCSS files, and one day I felt when the libs was implemented for the Nuxt project, those projects were not working as light-weight as expected! Neither the flexibility of applying the design token nor the overall performance caused by the CSS file. And I start thinking about rewriting the style files and reconsidering the page distribution in the project-based projects.

## Usage

1. clone this project 
2. create a directory `input-src/` under the project, and put the CSS file under the input-src directory
3. create a directory `out-tw-token/` under the project for the result JSON file.
4. execute the main script, `cargo run`
5. Ta Da~, the token is exported as array form.
